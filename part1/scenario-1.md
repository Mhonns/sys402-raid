I would recommend Alice implement RAID 0 (only stripping) because of many reasons. First, The most important reason, is that stripping across all 100 disks allows parallel reads. So, in practice, the performance will improve. Second, it is cost-effective so there is no additional hardware required. Alice can still use JBOD and use coarse-grained striping across many disks. Lastly, There is no redundancy overhead. However,  if one disk is down then the data will be lost.
