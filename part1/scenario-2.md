Using RAID 1 (pure mirroring) for HeartyShop would be an effective solution. Each disk would have an exact mirror copy, providing data protection against disk failures. For an e-commerce platform with 1 million daily transactions, RAID 1 provides strong data reliability through redundancy. However, It has high storage overhead making it more expensive per usable TB than RAID 5 or 6, and lower maximum read throughput compared to RAID 10 since it can't stripe across multiple disk pairs for parallel reads regardless of budget constraints Bob can use more SSDs to retain performance.
